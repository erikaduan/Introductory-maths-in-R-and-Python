# Introduction to triangles

A brief revision of triangles is shown below.

Triangles and angles are an important mathematical concept to revise, as
vector similarity is calculated based on concepts from geometry and
trigonometry. The definition of vector norms
i.e.Â ![||x||](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7C%7Cx%7C%7C
"||x||") and how they behave is also derived from insights from
trigonometry.

# Triangle inequality theorem

Any side of a triangle must be shorter than the other two sides added
together. If the side is equal to the other two sides, the length of one
side is 0 and the object is a line.

# Sine, Cosine and Tangent

Sine, Cosine and Tangent are just a ratio of two specific sides of a
right angled triangle.

We are therefore only interested in values ![0\\leq \\measuredangle
\\leq 90](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%5Cleq%20%5Cmeasuredangle%20%5Cleq%2090
"0\\leq \\measuredangle \\leq 90") and the values for Sine and Cosine
will always be between 0 and 1 (as the hypotenus is always equal to or
larger than the opposite and the adjacent).

``` python
#-----draw sine and cosine function in Python-----   
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.arange(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 0.1) 
sine = np.sin(x)
cosine = np.cos(x)

# Python allows you to directly plot NumPy array values  

sns.set_style('whitegrid', {
              'grid.linestyle': '--'})

sns.lineplot(x = x, y = sine, label = "Sine wave", lw = 3)

# The Sine rule

The [Sine rule](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-sine-law.html)
is useful for solving triangle angles and lengths, but does not have any
direct application to machine learning algorithms.

# The Cosine rule

In contrast, the [Cosine
rule](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-cosine-law.html) is
particularly useful for calculating object similarity in machine
learning, as it can be applied to calculate the angle between two
lengths, given that all lengths are known.

In trigonometry, the Cosine rule can be derived to find either an
unknown length given that two sides and the angle between them are
knownn, or an unknown angle given that all sides of the triangle are
known.
