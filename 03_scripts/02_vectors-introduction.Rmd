# What is a vector?  

A vector is a ordered and finite list of numbers (i.e. not character elements) and can be viewed as the most basic object in machine learning.  
Vectors can have any number of dimensions and are mathematical objects that can be added or multipled i.e. transformed into another vector.     

Different types of vectors exist:  

+ Geometrical vectors - lines with directions.        
+ [Polynomials](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials.html) - an algebraic expression that has multiple terms (constants, variables and exponents) like $f(x)=x^{2}+y+1$.          
+ Elements of ${\rm I\!R}^n$ - sets of real numbers. A vector in ${\rm I\!R}^3$ has the shape below.  
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  x_3
 \end{bmatrix}
 \in {\rm I\!R}^{3}$

```{python}
#-----create 1 dimensional vector in Python via Numpy-----
import numpy as np 

x = np.array([np.arange(1, 10+1)])
x.shape
#> (1, 10) 
```

```{python}
#-----create 3-dimensional vector in Python via Numpy-----
# note the placement of double square brackets [[y1],[y2],[y3]]

y = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])  
y.shape   
#> (3, 3)  
```


# Special vectors     

Special vectors include:  

+ Zero vectors - a vector which is only composed of zeros.  
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0
 \end{bmatrix}$  
+ Unit vectors - a vector containing a single element of 1 with remaining elements of zero. Useful for reducing the dimensions of a vector.  
$y = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0
 \end{bmatrix}$   
+ Sparse vectors - sparse vectors predominantly contain elements of zero. To maximise computational efficiency, we can represent sparse matrices by storing only its non-zero elements in a `[[row], [column], [value]]` triplet array.   
$y = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 \\
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \\
  0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
 \end{bmatrix}   
 y_{sparse} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0, 2, 3 \\
  2, 4, 1 
 \end{bmatrix}$   


# Vector dimensions and the coordinate system  

Vectors can have any number of dimensions. During our studies, we tend to encounter the 2-dimensional cartesian plane and 3-dimensional space, as these can be visualised as geometric vectors. In machine learning, however, we encounter problems involving tens, hundreds or even thousands of dimensions.  

The notation of a vector `x` of `n` dimensions is written below.    
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n
 \end{bmatrix} \in {\rm I\!R}^{n}$  

Vector dimensions map into coordinate systems, which have an origin at (0, 0, ..., 0).    
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  2 \\
  3 
 \end{bmatrix} \in {\rm I\!R}^{3}$ can therefore also be described as a position within a 3-dimensional coordinate system i.e. starting at (0, 0, 0), move 1 unit in the 1st perpendicular axis `x`, move 2 units in the 2nd perpendicular axis `y` and then move 3 units in the 3rd perpendicular axis `z`.    
 
 
# Basic vector operations  

## Vector-vector addition  

Vector-vector addition is performed element-wise and it only applies for vectors of the same size.    
 
$x + y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n
 \end{bmatrix}
 + 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  y_1 \\
  y_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  y_n
 \end{bmatrix} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 + y_1 \\
  x_2 + y_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n + y_n  
 \end{bmatrix}$   
 
Vector-vector addition has the following properties:  

+ It is commutative. $x + y = y + x$      
+ It is associative $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$       
+ Addition of the zero vector has no effect. $x + 0 = x$      
+ Subtracting the vector from itself returns the zero vector. $x - x = 0$       

```{python}
#-----create and add two vectors in Python via Numpy----  
x = np.array([[1, 1],
              [2, 2],
              [3, 3]])  

x.shape # 3-dimensional NumPy array  
#> (3, 2)

y = np.array([[1, 0],
              [0, 1],
              [1, 1]])

x + y
#> array([[2, 1],
#>        [2, 3],
#>        [4, 4]])

np.add(x, y)
#> array([[2, 1],
#>        [2, 3],
#>        [4, 4]])
```

```{r}
#-----create and add two vectors in R-----  
# vectors of n dimensions can be stored inside arrays   
# arrays are not typically used for analysis in R i.e. its 2D array matrix form is used instead       

x <- array(c(1, 1,
             2, 2,
             3, 3), 
           dim = c(1, 2, 3))

str(x)  
#>  num [1, 1:2, 1:3] 1 1 2 2 3 3  

y <- array(c(1, 0,
             0, 1,
             1, 1), 
           dim = c(1, 2, 3))  

str(x + y) 
#>  num [1, 1:2, 1:3] 2 1 2 3 4 4 
```


## Vector-scalar multiplication  

Vector-scalar multiplication is also an element-wise operation.     

$\alpha x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha x_1\\
 \alpha x_2\\
 \vdots \\
 \alpha x_n     
\end{bmatrix}$         

Vector-scalar multiplication has the following properties:   

+ It is associative. $(\alpha \times \beta )\times x = \alpha \times ( \beta \times x)$        
+ It is left-distributive. $(\alpha + \beta )x = \alpha x + \beta x$       
+ It is right-distributive. $x(\alpha + \beta ) = x\alpha + x\beta$     
+ It is right-distributive for vector addition. $\alpha (x+y)=\alpha x+ \alpha y$     

 
```{python}
#-----vector scalar multiplication in Python via Numpy-----
alpha = 4 

x = np.array([[1, 1],
              [2, 2],
              [3, 3]])  
             
alpha * x    
#> array([[ 4,  4],
#>        [ 8,  8],
#>        [12, 12]])
```

```{r}
#-----vector scalar multiplication in R-----  
alpha <- 4
x <- array(c(1, 1,
             2, 2,
             3, 3), 
           dim = c(1, 2, 3))

str(alpha * x)  
#>  num [1, 1:2, 1:3] 4 4 8 8 12 12    
```


## Vector linear combination        

A linear combination utilises the both rules of vector-vector addition and vector-scalar multiplication. 

There are a few different ways of thinking about linear combinations:  

+ Graphically as the addition of two vectors to form a new vector (which can also be visualised as a point in space) in the Cartesian plane.   
+ Mathmatically as the proof that any new vector can be created by a scalar combination of two existing basis vectors.      

![](https://github.com/erikaduan/Introductory-maths-in-R-and-Python/blob/master/02_figures/02_vectors-linear-combination.jpg)    

Another way to express linear combinations is with summation notation as $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_{i}x_{i}$.     

```{python}
#-----linear combination in Python via Numpy-----  
a, b = -2, 3 # input scalar values  

x = np.array([[2],
              [3]])

y = np.array([[4],
              [5]])  

a*x + b*y
#> array([[8],
#>        [9]]) 

#> [[-4 + 12],
#>  [-6 + 15]]  
```

```{r}
#-----linear combinations in R----- 
a <- -2
b <- 3

x <- array(c(2, 3), 
           dim = c(1, 2, 1))

y <- array(c(4, 5), 
           dim = c(1, 2, 1))

str(a*x + b*y)
#>  num [1, 1:2, 1] 8 9   
```


## Vector-vector multiplication (the dot-product)
