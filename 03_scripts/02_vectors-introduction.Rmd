# What is a vector?  

A vector is a ordered and finite list of numbers (i.e. not character elements) and can be viewed as the most basic object in machine learning.  
Vectors are mathematical objects that can be added or multipled i.e. transformed into another vector.     

Different types of vectors exist:  

+ Geometrical vectors - lines with directions.        
+ [Polynomials](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials.html) - an algebraic expression that has multiple terms (constants, variables and exponents) like $f(x) = x^{2}+y+1$.          
+ Elements of space ${\rm I\!R}^{n}$ - sets of real numbers. A vector in ${\rm I\!R}^{3}$ has the shape below.  
$x = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  x_3
 \end{bmatrix}
 \in {\rm I\!R}^{3}$
