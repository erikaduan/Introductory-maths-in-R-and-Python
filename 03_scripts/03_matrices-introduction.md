# What is a matrix?

A matrix can be thought of as a two dimensional container which stores a
set of vectors (i.e.Â an ordered collection of column vectors). A matrix
![A \\in {\\rm I\\!R} ^{m\\times n}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%5Cin%20%7B%5Crm%20I%5C%21R%7D%20%5E%7Bm%5Ctimes%20n%7D "A \in {\rm I\!R} ^{m\times n}")
is defined below.
